## Instructions

Reflection is a key activity of learning. It helps you build a strong metacognition, or "understanding of your own learning." A good learner not only "knows what they know", but they "know what they don't know", too. Learning to reflect takes practice, but if your goal is to become a self-directed learner where you can teach yourself things, reflection is imperative.

- Now that you've completed the assignment, share your throughts. What did you learn? What confuses you? Where did you struggle? Where might you need more practice?
- A good reflection is: **specific as possible**,  **uses the terminology of the problem domain** (what was learned in class / through readings), and **is actionable** (you can pursue next steps, or be aided in the pursuit). That last part is what will make you a self-directed learner.
- Flex your recall muscles. You might have to review class notes / assigned readings to write your reflection and get the terminology correct.
- Your reflection is for **you**. Yes I make you write them and I read them, but you are merely practicing to become a better self-directed learner. If you read your reflection 1 week later, does what you wrote advance your learning?

Examples:

- **Poor Reflection:**  "I don't understand loops."   
**Better Reflection:** "I don't undersand how the while loop exits."   
**Best Reflection:** "I struggle writing the proper exit conditions on a while loop." It's actionable: You can practice this, google it, ask Chat GPT to explain it, etc. 
-  **Poor Reflection** "I learned loops."   
**Better Reflection** "I learned how to write while loops and their difference from for loops."   
**Best Reflection** "I learned when to use while vs for loops. While loops are for sentiel-controlled values (waiting for a condition to occur), vs for loops are for iterating over collections of fixed values."

So going into this, parseing data/text into json format isnt new to me as i've taken 2 python classes before this one. The splitting for both / and in respectively was straight forward along with storing into lists and dictionaries. The only issue I had was getting the correct units stored into the dictionary. When I was running the code I noticed in the json file that the code didn't have the last unit in their line (ex: 1 bin, 1 carton) so I ended up asking chatgpt about it and then I started to get more issues. it worked fine with the other code I had for the unit and calculations but for some reason would duplicate the units now instead of getting each one one time. You can see it in my json file but I couldn't figure it out. It tried using set() which I think could be helpful if explained in class but I gave up in trying to differenciate it. The main other use I had for chat was just reading and writing the json file as I didn't remember exactly how to use them but after some explaination that was also straight forward. The if and for loops were also straight forward as I have used them in other classes and understand that for is for when you want to specify for specific observations within a file and if loops are mainly for when you need to specify data within certain observations. While loops I'm still a little confused on but didn't see a need to use them here so that's still something for me to work on.
